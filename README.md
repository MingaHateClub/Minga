# Minga
A decompilation of the Minga Cordova app.

## Why?
This year, Minga started getting used in my High School and I didn't exactly like that. The app violates a lot of our privacy and overall sucks to be forced to use.

## Progress
Right now, the Minga app is debuggable, however does not get past the login page, check Contributions for more information!

## Setup, Building and Running
For setup, first use
```
npm install
```
to install all the depenencies that Minga requires.

Now, check [the Building Guide](https://github.com/MingaHateClub/Minga/blob/main/BUILDING.md) to build Minga to different platforms.
## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! Please make a pull request if you have the time. The decompilation is not finished or fully functional yet, and even more features are planned.
