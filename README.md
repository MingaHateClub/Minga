# Minga
A decompilation of the Minga Cordova app.

## Why?
This year, Minga started getting used in my High School and I didn't exactly like that. The app violates a lot of our privacy and overall sucks to be forced to use.

## Progress
Right now, the Minga app is debuggable, however does not get past the login page, check Contributions for more information!

## Setup, Building and Running
For setup, first use
```
npm install
```
to install all the depenencies that Minga requires.
From there, you can now add build platforms:
```
cordova platform add browser
```
However, you can also add Android and iOS build options

**When building to Android, move google-services.json into platforms/android/app/**

If you want to run the app in a Chrome testing environment, run:
```
cordova run browser
```
## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! Please make a pull request if you have the time. The decompilation is not finished or fully functional yet, and even more features are planned.
